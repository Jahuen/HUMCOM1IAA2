                <ol>
                     <li>Measure the correct amount of rice and place it in a bowl.</li>
                     <li>Rinse the rice until the water turns clear.</li>
                     <li>Transfer the rice from the bowl to the inner pan of your rice cooker. You
                         <br> can also use a reusable rice napkin to make your cleanup afterwards easier.</li>
                        
                     <li>Add water to the rice cooker pan.</li>
                     <li>Place the pan inside your rice cooker and close the top. You can also add 
                        <br> any spices, oil, or butter at this step.</li>
                     <li>lug in your rice cooker and turn the cooker on. Most cookers have a light 
                        <br> on the front that indicates when the unit is on.</li>
                     <li>When your rice has finished cooking, the cooker will notify you by turning
                        <br> the light, flipping the switch up, or making a sound. After your rice has 
                        <br> finished cooking, let it rest for at least 15 minutes in the "keep warm" mode 
                        <br> before serving. This will let any excess moisture evaporate and allow your 
                        <br> rice to fully absorb the water.</li>
                     <li>Measure the correct amount of rice and place it in a bowl.</li>
                </ol>
